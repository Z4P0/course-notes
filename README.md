# Course Notes (WIP)

An 11ty site for course notetaking. [Demo](https://cocky-ramanujan-275bc4.netlify.app/).

Taking a course? Do you write your notes in text or markdown files? Fan of 11ty? Try this out.

Created while taking [Interaction Desing Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/) courses. Using now while taking [Learn UI Design](https://learnui.design/)


## Getting Started

1. `npm install`
2. Edit course name in `_data/config.json`
3. Run eleventy: `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve`


## Usage

Notes go in `notes`. Be sure to include the necessary front-matter.

The Nunjucks template will generate links to files in `notes`


## To-do
- YAML, for course name config
- Back/Next
- Screenshots gallery?
- Site styles
