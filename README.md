# Course Notes (WIP)

An 11ty site for course notetaking. [Demo](https://cocky-ramanujan-275bc4.netlify.app/).

Taking a course? Do you write your notes in text or markdown files? Fan of 11ty? Try this out.

Notes go in `notes`. Be sure to include the necessary front-matter.

Currently using it while taking [Interaction Desing Foundation](https://www.interaction-design.org/) courses.

To-do:
- YAML, for course name config
- Back/Next
- Screenshots gallery?
- Site styles
